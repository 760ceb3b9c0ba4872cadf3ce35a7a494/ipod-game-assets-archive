Textures were converted from .dat files within the `/textures` directory. 
The subfolder `statictexbank` contains the textures that were contained inside of the `/textures/statictexbank.dat` file rather than as individual files.

## Sounds
`a.m4a` and `b.m4a` were copied from the game's root directory.  
The subfolder `soundbank1` contains the sounds that were contained inside of the `audio/soundbank1.dat` file.
